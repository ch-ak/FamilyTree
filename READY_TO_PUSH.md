## ⚠️ Authentication Required

Git needs your GitHub credentials to push. I cannot enter passwords for security reasons.

**Choose the easiest option:**

### 🏆 RECOMMENDED: Personal Access Token (Quickest!)

1. **Create token**: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   - Name: "FamilyTree Mac"
   - Scope: ✅ repo (select all repo checkboxes)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **COPY IT** (you'll only see it once!)

2. **Push with token**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chakrikotcherlakota/Documents/FamilyTree
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   When prompted:
   - Username: `ch-ak`
   - Password: `[paste your token - NOT your GitHub password!]`

3. **Done!** Your code will upload to GitHub ☁️

### Alternative: GitHub CLI (Also Easy!)

```bash
# Install
brew install gh

# Authenticate (opens browser)
gh auth login

# Push
cd /Users/chakrikotcherlakota/Documents/FamilyTree
git push -u origin main
```

## After First Push

From then on, just run:
```bash
git push
```

Your credentials will be cached automatically!

## What You'll See on GitHub

After pushing, visit: **https://github.com/ch-ak/FamilyTree**

You'll see:
- ✅ All your code
- ✅ Complete commit history
- ✅ All documentation files
- ✅ Beautiful web interface to browse

## Future Workflow

```bash
# Make changes in Xcode
# Test your app

# Commit locally
git add -A
git commit -m "Added new feature"

# Push to GitHub (cloud backup!)
git push
```

## Full Instructions

See `GITHUB_PUSH_GUIDE.txt` for detailed step-by-step instructions for all authentication methods.
