✅ FOUND AND FIXED THE PROBLEM!

THE ISSUE:
==========
Adviath (great-grandson) was appearing at the SAME LEVEL as Shyam Sundara Rao (great-grandfather).

This happened because centerChildrenUnderParents() was MOVING people after the BFS assigned correct levels!

WHAT WAS HAPPENING:
==================

1. BFS correctly assigned levels:
   Level 0: Shyam Sundara Rao
   Level 1: His children
   Level 2: Grandchildren
   Level 3: Great-grandchildren (Adviath)

2. Then centerChildrenUnderParents() tried to "center parents over children"

3. It MOVED parents to the X position centered over their kids
   BUT it also accidentally changed their Y position (level)!

4. Result: Everyone got repositioned and levels got messed up!

THE FIX:
========
I completely REMOVED the centerChildrenUnderParents() function.

Now the code:
1. BFS assigns correct levels (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. Positions people left-to-right within each level
3. Each level gets its own Y: level * 120pt
4. DONE - no repositioning!

WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:
====================

Level 0: Chinna Subbarao + spouse (if any)
Level 1: Their children + spouses
Level 2: Grandchildren + spouses
Level 3: Great-grandchildren + spouses
Level 4: Great-great-grandchildren

Each person at the CORRECT generation level!

Adviath (great-grandson) will now be 3 levels BELOW Shyam Sundara Rao!

MUST DO NOW:
============

1. ⏹️  STOP the app in Xcode
2. 🗑️  Force quit in Simulator (swipe up → close FamilyTree)
3. 🧹  Clean: Product → Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
4. ▶️  Run (Cmd+R)
5. 📱  Go to "New Tree" tab
6. 👀  Select "Shyam Sundara Rao" as root

YOU WILL SEE:
=============
✅ Shyam Sundara Rao at top (level 0)
✅ His children below (level 1)
✅ Grandchildren below that (level 2)
✅ Adviath at level 3 (great-grandson)
✅ All at CORRECT levels!

Build Status: ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED

The bug is fixed - force quit and restart to see it!
