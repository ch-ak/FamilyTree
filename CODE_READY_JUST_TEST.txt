🎯 THE FIX IS ALREADY APPLIED - JUST TEST IT!
==============================================

✅ **THE CODE IS READY IN THE FILE!**

I just verified - the D3FamilyTreeTabView.swift file 
ALREADY HAS the ultra-thin 0.5px styling with forced 
inline styles!

**The file contains:**
```javascript
link.setAttribute('stroke-width', '0.5');  ✅
link.setAttribute('stroke', '#999');        ✅
link.style.strokeWidth = '0.5px';          ✅ FORCED!
link.style.stroke = '#999';                ✅ FORCED!
```

---

## 🚨 YOU JUST NEED TO TEST IT:

**CRITICAL STEPS:**

1. **FORCE QUIT THE APP**
   - Swipe up from bottom
   - Find Family Tree app
   - Swipe it UP to close
   - ⚠️ THIS IS MANDATORY!

2. **Cmd+R** in Xcode
   - Rebuilds with the new code

3. **D3 Tree tab**
   - Wait for tree to load

4. **Tap share** (↗️)
   - Wait 2-3 seconds

5. **Open PDF**
   - See ultra-thin 0.5px lines! 🎉

---

## ⚠️ WHY FORCE QUIT IS CRITICAL:

The WebView caches the old JavaScript code.
Even rebuilding won't help if the app is still running.

**You MUST completely close the app first!**

---

## ✅ WHAT'S IN THE CODE:

- ✅ Ultra-thin 0.5px lines (not 2-3px!)
- ✅ Light gray #999 color (not black!)
- ✅ Small 3px circles (not 6-8px!)
- ✅ Compact 8px text
- ✅ Both setAttribute AND inline styles (FORCED!)
- ✅ No text shadows (clean rendering)

---

## 🎊 BUILD STATUS:

```
✅ CODE IS IN THE FILE
✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED
✅ ULTRA-THIN STYLING READY
✅ JUST NEEDS TESTING
```

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
