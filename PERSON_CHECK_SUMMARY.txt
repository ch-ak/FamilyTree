🎯 QUICK SUMMARY - PERSON EXISTENCE CHECK
==========================================

✅ **FEATURE COMPLETE & WORKING!**

## WHAT IT DOES:

When you enter a person's name in Chat Wizard:
- ✅ Checks if they already exist in database
- ✅ Shows their details if found
- ✅ Asks what you want to add (mother, father, spouse, siblings, children)
- ✅ Lets you create a different person if it's not a match

## EXAMPLE:

```
You: "Chakri Kocherlakota 1989"

Bot: "I found Chakri Kocherlakota (born 1989) in the database.
     
     No relationships added yet.
     
     Is this you? What would you like to add?
     (mother, father, spouse, siblings, children, or type 'new')"

You: "mother"

Bot: "Great! Tell me your mother's full name and year of birth."
```
