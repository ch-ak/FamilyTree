# Kocherlakota Family Tree App - User Guide

## 📱 Welcome to Our Shared Family Tree!

This app helps our entire Kocherlakota family build a collaborative family tree together. Everyone in the WhatsApp group can contribute their branch, and the app automatically connects everyone!

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Smart Duplicate Detection**
- ✅ The app **automatically detects** if a person already exists
- ✅ **Prevents duplicates** - won't create multiple entries for the same person
- ✅ **Fuzzy matching** - matches names even if birth year is off by ±2 years
- ✅ Shows "✅ Found in tree!" when someone already exists

### **Automatic Linking**
- ✅ **Auto-connects siblings** to your parents
- ✅ **Auto-links spouses** to each other
- ✅ **Auto-links children** to both parents
- ✅ **Builds connections** as more family members contribute

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ **Use Full Names**
- ❌ Wrong: "Ramesh"
- ✅ Right: "Ramesh Kocherlakota"

### ✅ **Be Consistent with Names**
- Use the same spelling everyone uses
- Example: If your dad is "Murthy" to some and "Murty" to others, pick one

### ✅ **Birth Year is Important**
- Helps identify the right person
- Approximate is OK (will match ±2 years)

### ✅ **Don't Worry About Duplicates**
- The app will find existing people
- You'll see "✅ Found in tree!" when it happens

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: What if I make a mistake?
A: Just run the wizard again - it will update the information

### Q: What if someone's already in the tree?
A: The app shows "✅ Found in tree!" and just creates the link

### Q: What if two people have the same name?
A: Birth year helps distinguish them. The app uses name + birth year for matching.

### Q: Can I add more people later?
A: Yes! Just run the wizard again for additional family members

### Q: What if my sibling already added our parents?
A: Perfect! The app will find them and just link you to them (no duplicates)

### Q: Do I need to add everyone in my family?
A: No! Just add yourself and your immediate family. Others can add themselves.

## 📊 What Makes This Smart

### **Collaborative Intelligence**
- 200 people × 5 family members each = **1000 person database**
- But with duplicates removed = **~200-300 unique people**
- Everyone's contributions merge automatically!

### **Auto-Connection Example**
```
You enter: Father = "Ramesh K, 1960"
Your cousin enters: Uncle = "Ramesh K, 1960"
App realizes: Same person!
Auto-connects you as cousins through Ramesh!
```

### **Smart Relationships**
- If you add a sibling, app auto-links them to your parents
- If you add a child, app auto-links them to your spouse
- Creates bidirectional relationships (if A is sibling of B, then B is sibling of A)
