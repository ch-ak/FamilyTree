The issue is that when adding siblings like Lavanya, Karunya, and Saranya:
- Lavanya is linked to Karunya ✓
- Lavanya is linked to Saranya ✓
- But Karunya is NOT linked to Saranya ✗

This is because handleEnterSiblings only links each new sibling to ME (selfPersonId),
but doesn't link them to previously added siblings.

The fix: After line 326 (linking to parents), add this code before "notifyDataUpdated()":

        // Link new sibling to ALL previously added siblings
        for existingSiblingId in siblingIds {
            try await useCase.linkSibling(personId: sibling.id, siblingId: existingSiblingId)
            print("✅ Linked \(sibling.fullName) as sibling to existing sibling")
        }
        
        // Add this sibling to the list for future siblings
        siblingIds.append(sibling.id)

Also need to:
1. Add "private var siblingIds: [UUID] = []" to the properties (line 28)
2. Add "siblingIds.removeAll()" to resetState() method

This will ensure:
- Karunya added → Linked to Lavanya ✓
- Saranya added → Linked to Lavanya AND Karunya ✓✓
